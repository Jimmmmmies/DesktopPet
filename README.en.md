## ✨ Features

- 🎭 Multiple emotional states: normal, working (other states are easter eggs for you to discover!)
- 🕒 Hourly time alerts: automatic time reminders at the top of each hour
- 🔋 Status management: happiness and energy value system

- 🖱️ Drag function: freely move the pet around your screen
